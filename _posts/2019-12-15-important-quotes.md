These are some quotes I have in my notes for the past couple of years and I believe considering these things made my code quality and planning better.

## Coding

1. **Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.**
   <br/>
   _― Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 1999_
   <br/><br/>

2. **You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.**
   <br/>
   _― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_
   <br/><br/>

3. **A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment.**
   <br/>
   _― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_
   <br/><br/>

4. **Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it.**
   <br/>
   _― Brian W. Kernighan, The Elements of Programming Style_
   <br/><br/>

5. **Premature optimization is the root of all evil.**
   <br/>
   _― Donald Ervin Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms_
   <br/><br/>

6. **Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.**
   <br/>
   _― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_
   <br/><br/>

## Planning

1. **If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.**
   <br/>
   _― Albert Einstein (I'm not 100% sure)_
   <br/><br/>
2. **The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.**
   <br/>
   _― Fred Brooks_
   <br/><br/>
